## Description:
The Private Police "Phorce" is a non-profit civic platform designed to collect and process 
police-related reports from civilians when public police departments cannot take them 
due to cost, staffing shortages, or jurisdictional limitations. This system ensures that 
critical community concerns are documented, preserving evidence and information for 
future law enforcement, insurance, or civil purposes.
